Marriage in Spain

## Before you start

Contact the [civil registry office](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC&lang=en_gb) where you're planning to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you'll need.

%One of you must live in Spain or be a Spanish national.%

## Prove you're free to get married

What you need varies across Spain.

The civil registry office will ask for one or both of the following:

+ a [certificate of no impediment (CNI)](/government/publications/example-certificate-of-no-impediment-cni)
+ a [marital status certificate](/government/publications/marital-status-example)

Show these example certificates to the civil registry where you're getting married and ask them which you need.

If your partner is British they'll need the same certificates. If they're not British they'll need equivalent documents from their local authorities.

^ Apply for all your certificates at least 3 months before you get married. You need to present all your paperwork when you open the marriage application at the civil registry office.

The civil registry office will also ask you for proof of your address. This should be:

- a utility bill or bank statement - if you don't live in Spain
- your registration certificate from the town hall ('ayuntamiento') - if you live in Spain

If you've lived in Spain for less than 2 years, you might also need to provide the ['communication proof of address'](/government/publications/communication-regarding-proof-of-address-spain).

### Get a CNI ('capacidad matrimonial')

Download and fill in the [CNI application pack](/government/publications/certificate-of-no-impediment-application-pack). The pack contains a list of the documents you'll need.

You must sign the notice of marriage and affirmation in the application pack in front of a local [notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/) in Spain.

Send the form and documents by registered post to the address in the application pack.

The consulate will display your notice of marriage for 7 days. If nobody raises an objection, they'll issue your CNI and send it to you with your original documents by registered post. You'll usually get your CNI 30 working days after the consulate receives your form and documents.

It costs £50 to give notice and £50 for the CNI. You'll need to pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/spain-consular-fees) or by card. Fill in the payment form in the pack.

^Your CNI will be valid for 3 months.^

### Get a marital status certificate ('certificado de estado civil/soltería')

Download and fill in the [marital status certificate application pack](/government/publications/marital-status-certificate-for-marriage-application-pack) - it contains a list of the documents you'll need. The certificate costs £50.

You must sign the affirmation in the application pack in front of a local [notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/) in Spain. They'll charge you a fee.

Send the form and documents by registered post to the address in the application pack.

The consulate will send your certificate and original documents to you by registered post. You'll usually get your certificate 30 working days after the consulate receives your form and documents.

## Get married

You can have a civil wedding or a Catholic wedding.

Other religious ceremonies aren't valid on their own. You'll need to have a civil wedding as well.

### Civil weddings

Take your certificates to the civil registry office where you're planning to get married. The registrar will check your documents and set a date for your wedding.

### Catholic weddings

Take your certificates to the priest who's going to marry you. The priest will check your documents and set a date for your wedding.

^After your ceremony the priest must register your marriage at the local civil registry office. You won't be legally married until this has happened.^

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Spain
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won't need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn't a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.
