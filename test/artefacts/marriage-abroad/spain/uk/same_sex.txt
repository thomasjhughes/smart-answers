Marriage in Spain

## Before you start

Contact the [civil registry office](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC&lang=en_gb) where you're planning to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you and your partner will need.

%One of you must live in Spain or be a Spanish national.%

## Prove you're free to get married

What you need varies across Spain.

The civil registry office will ask for one or both of:

- a [certificate of no impediment (CNI)](/government/publications/example-certificate-of-no-impediment-cni)
- a [marital status certificate](/government/publications/marital-status-example)

If your partner is British they'll need the same certificates. If they're not British they'll need equivalent documents from their local authorities.

^ Apply for all your certificates at least 3 months before you get married. You need to present all your paperwork when you open the marriage application at the civil registry office.

The civil registry office will also ask you for proof of your address. This should be:

- a utility bill or bank statement - if you don't live in Spain
- your registration certificate from the town hall ('ayuntamiento') - if you live in Spain

If you've lived in Spain for less than 2 years, you might also need to provide the ['communication proof of address'](/government/publications/communication-regarding-proof-of-address-spain).

### Get a CNI  ('capacidad matrimonial')

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage.

^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)^

You'll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.

You must download and fill in the [CNI application pack](/government/publications/uk-cni-pack) to exchange your UK-issued CNI for one that's valid in Spain. The pack contains a list of the documents you'll need.

Send the form and documents by registered post to the address in the application pack.

The consulate will issue your CNI and send it to you with your original documents by registered post. You'll usually get your CNI 30 working days after the consulate receives your form and documents.

^Your new CNI will be valid for 3 months from when your original CNI was issued.^

It costs £50 to give notice and £50 for the CNI. You'll need to pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/spain-consular-fees) or by card. Fill in the payment form in the pack.

### Get a marital status certificate ('certificado de estado civil/soltería')

Download and fill in the [marital status certificate application pack](/government/publications/marital-status-certificate-for-marriage-application-pack) - it contains a list of the documents you'll need. The certificate costs £50.

You must sign the affirmation in the application pack in front of a local [notary public](http://www.notaries-directory.eu/) in Spain. They'll charge you a fee.

Send the form and documents by registered post to the address in the application pack.

The consulate will send your certificate and original documents to you by registered post. You'll usually get your certificate 30 working days after the consulate receives your form and documents.

## Get married

You can only have a civil wedding.

Take your certificates to the civil registry office where you're planning to get married. The registrar will check your documents and set a date for your wedding.

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Spain
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won't need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn't a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they've lived in the UK for 3 years.

*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment
