Marriage in Spain

## Prove you're free to get married

What you need varies across Spain. You'll be asked for one or both of the following:

- a certificate of no impediment (CNI)
- a marital status certificate

You can either get a CNI in:

- [the UK](/marriage-abroad/y/spain/uk/same_sex)
- [Spain](/marriage-abroad/y/spain/ceremony_country/same_sex)

*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment
