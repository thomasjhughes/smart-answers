You can’t use simplified expenses for your current vehicle because you’ve already claimed capital allowances for it.

You should continue to claim your actual vehicle expenses, and [capital allowances](/capital-allowances) where relevant.

If you get a new vehicle and use it for your business, you can claim flat rate simplified expenses for it if it suits you.
