Based on your answers you would probably be better off working out your expenses based on the actual costs.

These 2 sets of results show what you can claim using each method.

You don’t have to use the same method for different types of expenses. For example, you can use simplified expenses for vehicle costs but work out the actual costs for working from home.

##Simplified expenses

- £4,500 to claim for cars and vans

- £216 to claim for working from home

**Total to claim per year:** £4,716

###What to do for your tax return

Use the simplified expenses flat rates to work out your business expenses.

Multiply the flat rates with the [miles you drove](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-), [hours you work from home](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/business-use-of-your-home) or the [number of people who live on your business premises](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/private-use-of-business-premises).
