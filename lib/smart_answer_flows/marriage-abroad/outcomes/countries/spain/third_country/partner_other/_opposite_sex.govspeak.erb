Contact the relevant local authorities in Spain to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Spain](/foreign-travel-advice/spain) before making any plans.

%There are certain legal restrictions on getting married in Spain if neither of you lives there. If you both live outside Spain, you must check with the [civil registry](http://www.mjusticia.gob.es/BUSCADIR/ServletControlador?apartado=buscadorGeneral&tipo=RC) where you’re planning to get married to find out if this is allowed.%

##What you need to do

You'll be asked to provide a [certificate of no impediment (CNI)](/government/publications/example-certificate-of-no-impediment-cni), a [marital status certificate](/government/publications/marital-status-example) or both to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Check with the civil registry  where you’re getting married to find out what certificate you’ll need.

There are 2 ways you can get these certificates:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/spain/uk/partner_other/opposite_sex)
- [go to Spain and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/spain/ceremony_country/partner_other/opposite_sex)

You need to apply for all certificates at least 3 months before the date you intend to get married.

You must be physically present in Spain for at least 3 days before you apply for a CNI.
