  ###What to do for your tax return

  Use the simplified expenses flat rates to work out your business expenses.

  Multiply the flat rates with the [miles you drove](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-), [hours you work from home](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/business-use-of-your-home) or the [number of people who live on your business premises](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/private-use-of-business-premises).

  ###What to do for your tax return

  You’ll have to work out the split between private and business use for vehicles, working from home or business premises use.

  You’ll then have to add up your expenses for your tax return and [keep records](/self-employed-records) for every expense you want to claim, eg copies of your bills.
