    ##For your vehicle

    You can’t use simplified expenses for your vehicle because you’ve already claimed capital allowances for it.

    You have to continue to calculate your vehicle expenses by working out the actual costs.

    ##For your other business expenses

  <% elsif calculator.simplified_expenses_claimed? %>
    ##For your vehicle
    Based on your answers you would probably be better off [using simplified expenses/working out your expenses based on the actual costs].

    You can’t claim capital allowances for your vehicle because you’ve already claimed simplified expenses for it.

    ##For your other business expenses

  <% end %>
  Based on your answers you would probably be better off <% if simple_total > current_scheme_costs %>using simplified expenses<% else %>working out your expenses based on the actual costs<% end %>.

  These 2 sets of results show what you can claim using each method.

  You don’t have to use the same method for different types of expenses. For example, you can use simplified expenses for vehicle costs but work out the actual costs for working from home.

  ##If you use simplified expenses

  You could claim:

  <% unless calculator.capital_allowance_claimed? or calculator.simple_vehicle_costs_car_van.to_f == 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(calculator.simple_vehicle_costs_car_van) %> for your car or van
  <% end %>

  ^This is an estimate. You should do your own calculations for your tax return.^

  <% if calculator.simple_vehicle_costs_motorcycle.to_f > 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(calculator.simple_vehicle_costs_motorcycle) %> to claim for motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% if calculator.list_of_expenses.include?("using_home_for_business") %>
    <% if simple_home_costs.to_f == 0.0 %>
      - you have to work at least 25 hours per month from home to use simplified expenses
    <% else %>
      - <%= format_money(simple_home_costs) %> to claim for working from home

  <% end %>

  <% if simple_business_costs.to_f > 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(simple_business_costs) %> to deduct from your total business costs - you then claim the balance
  <% end %>

  <% if calculator.capital_allowance_claimed? %>

  ###What to do for your tax return

  Use the [simplified expenses flat rates](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-) to work out your business expenses.

  Multiply the flat rates with either:

  [the miles you drove](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-)
  [the hours you worked from home](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/working-from-home)
  [the number of people who lived on your business premises](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/living-at-your-business-premises)

  ##If you work out the actual costs

  You could claim:

  <% if vehicle_costs.to_f > 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(vehicle_costs.to_f) %> for the running costs of your car, van or motorcycle
  <% end %>

  <% if capital_allowances_estimate.to_f > 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(capital_allowances_estimate.to_f) %> of [capital allowances](/capital-allowances) for your car, van or motorcycle
  <% end %>

  <% if home_costs.to_f > 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(home_costs) %> for working from home
  <% end %>

  <% if simple_business_costs.to_f > 0.0 %>
    - <%= format_money(business_premises_cost) %> to deduct from your total business costs - you then claim the balance
  <% end %>

  <% if green_vehicle_write_off.to_f > 0.0 &&
      expenses_or_allowances != "no" %>
    - <%= format_money(green_vehicle_write_off) %> for cars, vans and motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% if dirty_vehicle_write_off.to_f > 0.0 &&
      expenses_or_allowances != "no" %>
    - <%= format_money(dirty_vehicle_write_off) %> for cars, vans and motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% if filthy_vehicle_write_off.to_f > 0.0 &&
      expenses_or_allowances != "no" %>
    - <%= format_money(filthy_vehicle_write_off) %> for cars, vans and motorcycles
  <% end %>

  <% if (calculator.list_of_expenses - ['live_on_business_premises']).empty? %>
    **Total to claim per year:**
  <% else %>
    **Total to claim per year:** <%= format_money(current_scheme_costs) %>
  <% end %>

  <% if calculator.over_limit? %>
    The upper limit for Capital Allowance write offs for vans is £250,000.

  ###What to do for your tax return

  You have to work out the split between private and business use for vehicles, working from home or business premises use.

  You then have to add up your expenses for your tax return and [keep records](/self-employed-records) for every expense you want to claim, eg copies of your bills.

  [Self Assessment tax returns](/self-assessment-tax-returns)
